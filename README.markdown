# Runit cluster

Web interface for management multiple installations of runit.

Based on

* [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/)
* [runit-man](https://github.com/Undev/runit-man)

## Installation

It seems we need to write down something here

## Configuration

Customize your `host_config.yml` file with instances of your cluster.
You need to define credentials to each host

1. Hostname
2. Port
3. Login
4. Password

Example:

    -
      host: host1
      addr: 192.168.0.1
      port: 4567
      login: user1
      pass: password1
    -
      host: host2
      addr: 192.168.0.2
      port: 4567
      login: user2
      pass: password2

## Interface

Runit cluster provides interface similar to [runit-man](https://github.com/Undev/runit-man), but with aggregated data from all configured hosts.

### View

Data for each process includes:

-  Hostname
